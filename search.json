"content"  : "We can notice several kinds of results:  The results you get slowly and inconsistently  The results you get slowly and effectively  The results you get faster and inconsistently  The results you get faster and effectivelyImagine that you have access to the best therapist/coaches of the whole time the kind of people who makes people get the results from number 4 and you get access to them and finally develop an approach to get the greatest results. NLP was created this way. For example, Milton Erickson has being one of the greatest psychiatrist of the whole time, his patients he was getting results faster and effectively and NLP born from developing the same things that Milton Erickson and other great psychiatrist were doing with their patients.Nevertheless, NLP is not the answer for everything. Actually it needs to be combined with some other approaches for getting the results from number 4. So when I say “the NLP approach” what I mean is the NLP approach combined with other effective approaches but taking NLP as a base and a pillar to breakthrough and create the results faster and effectively.As everyone I struggle with habits, patterns, emotions, thoughts and believes.I tried to find ways for achieving the results I wanted. And I found something important, if you want to achieve a specific result in your life you have plenty of options, techniques, strategies and methods and most of them make sense when you study them and some others don’t.The key here is you can struggle to get the results with one approach for 1 year and achieve little progress or you can take another approach that will give you the results that you want faster and effectively. The question is “what should I choose?”. Hopefully I can share with you my results and experiences using the NLP approach so you can apply them also and start getting the results you want no matter what."

"content"  : "&quot;Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus&quot; by Mary Shelley was result of an improvised ghost story as part of entertainment  while she was visiting a common friend of her and his husband 200 years ago. Besides having a lot of interpretations, this work shows how people can react to new technologies. By the time Shelley wrote Frankenstein, a new technology was appearing of course I’m talking about electricity. The new technology was unknown for most researches and for population it was source of fears and imagination. We all know Frankenstein and the idea people was dealing with at that time was “you can give life with electricity an unwanted life that will hurt humans”.Does this sound like something we are dealing with right now? Let’s change electricity for Artificial Intelligence.The idea we are dealing with now is “you can give life with A.I. an unwanted life that will hurt humans”.Let’s take a look back to electricity, 200 years after Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein is very hard to think about doing our current activities without electricity it moves our homes, works and environments.  If we could talk to the people Mary Shelley was telling the Frankenstein story 200 years ago what would we tell them?  What would tell us the people from 200 years after 2018 about A.I.?"

"content"  : "This is how I achieved to run android platform specific code withlibGDX, this example is aboutrunning a Toast.Project exampleThanks to Ákos Kovács for hisproject example.Action ResolverAdd an ActionResolver interface under the core project.public interface ActionResolver {    public void showToast(CharSequence text);}Here you can add the methods you’re going to need, this example onlyhandles a toast, so for showing a toast I have made a showToastmethod which takes a text, this text is the text the toast will show.Action Resolver for AndroidAdd an ActionResolverAndroid class under the android project.public class ActionResolverAndroid implements ActionResolver {    Handler handler;    Context context;    public ActionResolverAndroid(Context context) {        handler = new Handler();        this.context = context;    }    public void showToast(final CharSequence text) {        handler.post(new Runnable() {            @Override            public void run() {                Toast.makeText(context, text, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();            }        });    }}Here we define the showToast method, to be able to show a toast weneed a handler, be sure you import the import android.os.Handler;and not other one (I committed that mistake).The handler is just needed if you’re going to show some GUI stuff.Cannot resolve method errorSome methods will require you to prepend the context, so for exampletrying to invoke the method startActivity(intent) will lead youto an error, to solve this prepend the context as follows.context.startActivity(intent);Your GameUnder your core project there is a class which extends for the Gameclass, in this example that game class is called YourGame, add thefollowing.public class YourGame extends Game {    public ActionResolver actionResolver;Add the following in the constructor.public YourGame(ActionResolver actionResolver) {    this.actionResolver = actionResolver;Android LauncherUnder your android project there is a class named AndroidLauncher,we need to edit that class, It should look like this.public class AndroidLauncher extends AndroidApplication {    ActionResolverAndroid actionResolverAndroid;    @Override    protected void onCreate (Bundle savedInstanceState) {        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);        actionResolverAndroid = new ActionResolverAndroid(this);        AndroidApplicationConfiguration config = new AndroidApplicationConfiguration();        initialize(new YourGame(actionResolverAndroid), config);    }}Your ScreensIn this case you will commonly try to use a Toast in a Screen.Create a new screen like follows.public class YourScreen implements Screen {    YourGame game;Then modify YourScreen class constructor like follows.public YourScreen(final YourGame game) {    this.game = game;Now from YourGame class you’ll set the new screen like this:this.setScreen(new YourScreen(this));Invoking the showToast methodIn a Screen you can invoke it in the show mehtod.@Overridepublic void show() {To invoke it use the following.game.actionResolver.showToast(&quot;Hi!&quot;);Send data back to gameSometimes we’ll need to inform about data changes back to the game. Wedo this as follows.Gdx.app.postRunnable(new Runnable() {    @Override    public void run() {        /* Here goes some data to send back to game */        game.progressLoaded = true;    }});"
