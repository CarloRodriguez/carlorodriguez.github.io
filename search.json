"content"  : "We can notice several kinds of results:  The results you get slowly and inconsistently  The results you get slowly and effectively  The results you get faster and inconsistently  The results you get faster and effectivelyImagine that you have access to the best therapist/coaches of the whole time the kind of people who makes people get the results from number 4 and you get access to them and finally develop an approach to get the greatest results. NLP was created this way. For example, Milton Erickson has being one of the greatest psychiatrist of the whole time, his patients he was getting results faster and effectively and NLP born from developing the same things that Milton Erickson and other great psychiatrist were doing with their patients.Nevertheless, NLP is not the answer for everything. Actually it needs to be combined with some other approaches for getting the results from number 4. So when I say “the NLP approach” what I mean is the NLP approach combined with other effective approaches but taking NLP as a base and a pillar to breakthrough and create the results faster and effectively.As everyone I struggle with habits, patterns, emotions, thoughts and believes.I tried to find ways for achieving the results I wanted. And I found something important, if you want to achieve a specific result in your life you have plenty of options, techniques, strategies and methods and most of them make sense when you study them and some others don’t.The key here is you can struggle to get the results with one approach for 1 year and achieve little progress or you can take another approach that will give you the results that you want faster and effectively. The question is “what should I choose?”. Hopefully I can share with you my results and experiences using the NLP approach so you can apply them also and start getting the results you want no matter what."

"content"  : "&quot;Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus&quot; by Mary Shelley was result of an improvised ghost story as part of entertainment while she was visiting a common friend of her and his husband 200 years ago. Besides having a lot of interpretations, this work shows how people can react to new technologies. By the time Shelley wrote Frankenstein a new technology was appearing. Of course I’m talking about electricity. The new technology was unknown for most researches and for population it was source of fears and imagination. We all know Frankenstein, the idea people was dealing with at that time was “you can give life with electricity an unwanted life that will hurt humans”.Does this sound like something we are dealing with nowadays? Let’s change electricity for Artificial Intelligence.The idea nowadays is “you can give life with A.I. an unwanted life that will hurt humans”.Let’s take a look back to electricity, 200 years after Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein is very hard to think about doing our current activities without electricity. Electricity moves our homes, works and environments.  If we could talk to the people Mary Shelley was telling the Frankenstein story 200 years ago, what would we tell them?  What would tell us the people from 200 years after 2018 about A.I.?"

Fish is not POSIX compatible. Most projects already use POSIX, so fish is a great shell but most resources out there are POSIX compatible. So I’m attached to zsh now.AutojumpRunning cd to browse a bunch of directories is a pain, autojumphelps me to cd into directories in a faster and efficiently.Material ThemeI’m a fan of material design and material themes for shell and text editors are great as well. Colors are really important to me, it defines whether I can see aterminal all day or not, but is also a matter of taste, so I use hyperterm-material.FontIf you can distinguish between the following characters:i I l L 1 o O 0Then that’s the right font for you.I’m currently using Hack."

Wedo this as follows.Gdx.app.postRunnable(new Runnable() {    @Override    public void run() {        /* Here goes some data to send back to game */        game.progressLoaded = true;    }});"
