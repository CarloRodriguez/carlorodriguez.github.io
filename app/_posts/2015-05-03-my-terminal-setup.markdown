## UNIX-like environment

To me a UNIX-like system for developing software is a must have.

## Hyper

I use [hyper](https://hyper.is/) as my terminal application.

But most of the time I run shells under Emacs with `ansi-term`.

## Fish <a name="fish" ></a>

The reason I'm attached to [fish](http://fishshell.com/) is the
Autosuggestions feature.

I run shell commands very often and some times I
can't remember which arguments the command takes exactly,
as soon as I type the first chars of the command
fish suggest me how to complete such command, it suggests a
previous commands I've executed.

Another thing is fish highlights invalid commands as default, coloring
them with red, e.g. if I misspell `gti` I can prevent myself
from running that invalid command and rectify it with `git`.

#### Consider before using Fish

Many people complaint because fish isn't POSIX/bash-compliant, is that
truly bad as for not using it? see this
[topic](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5723235).

## Autojump

Running `cd` to browse a bunch of directories is a pain, autojump
helps me to `cd` into directories in a faster and less mental effort
way.

Get it from [here](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump)

## Pure theme

I use [Pure.fish](https://github.com/brandonweiss/pure.fish) as the
command prompt theme.

## Color theme

Colors are really important to me, it defines whether I can see a
terminal all day or not, but is also a matter of taste, so I really
like:

## Font

If you can distinguish between the following characters:
`i` `I` `l` `L` `1` `o` `O` `0`
Then that's the right font for you.

I'm currently using [Hack](http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/).
