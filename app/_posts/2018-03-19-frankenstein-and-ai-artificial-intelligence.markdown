`"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus"` by Mary Shelley was result of an improvised ghost story as part of entertainment  while she was visiting a common friend of her and his husband 200 years ago. Besides having a lot of interpretations, this work shows how people can react to new technologies. By the time Shelley wrote Frankenstein, a new technology was appearing of course I'm talking about electricity. The new technology was unknown for most researches and for population it was source of fears and imagination. We all know Frankenstein and the idea people was dealing with at that time was "you can give life with electricity an unwanted life that will hurt humans".

Does this sound like something we are dealing with right now? Let's change electricity for Artificial Intelligence.

The idea we are dealing with now is "you can give life with A.I. an unwanted life that will hurt humans".

Let's take a look back to electricity, 200 years after Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein is very hard to think about doing our current activities without electricity it moves our homes, works and environments.

- If we could talk to the people Mary Shelley was telling the Frankenstein story 200 years ago what would we tell them?
- What would tell us the people from 200 years after 2018 about A.I.?
