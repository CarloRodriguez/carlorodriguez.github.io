We can notice several kinds of results:

1. The results you get slowly and inconsistently
2. The results you get slowly and effectively
3. The results you get faster and inconsistently
4. The results you get faster and effectively

Imagine that you have access to the best therapist/coaches of the whole time the kind of people who makes people get the results from number 4 and you get access to them and finally develop an approach to get the greatest results. NLP was created this way. For example, [Milton Erickson][Milton-Erickson] has being one of the greatest psychiatrist of the whole time, his patients he was getting results faster and effectively and NLP born from developing the same things that Milton Erickson and other great psychiatrist were doing with their patients.

Nevertheless, NLP is not the answer for everything. Actually it needs to be combined with some other approaches for getting the results from number 4. So when I say "the NLP approach" what I mean is the NLP approach combined with other effective approaches but taking NLP as a base and a pillar to breakthrough and create the results faster and effectively.

[Milton-Erickson]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_H._Erickson

As everyone I struggle with habits, patterns, emotions, thoughts and believes.

I tried to find ways for achieving the results I wanted. And I found something important, if you want to achieve a specific result in your life you have plenty of options, techniques, strategies and methods and most of them make sense when you study them and some others don't.

The key here is you can struggle to get the results with one approach for 1 year and achieve little progress or you can take another approach that will give you the results that you want faster and effectively. The question is "what should I choose?". Hopefully I can share with you my results and experiences using the NLP approach so you can apply them also and start getting the results you want no matter what.
