I'm a Senior Full Stack & Mobile Developer with almost 5 years of
professional experience. I'm a code poet, if is not
delightful to read I'm not completely satisfied with my code.
I like React and Git technologies too much. My favorite language is
JavaScript with ES6 and flow. If I can do all my work over a terminal I'm
completely happy.
I'm a firm believer of the material design principles and mobile-like
interface approaches. Can't code professional without vim-like
keybindings, normal key bindings are just to slow for my ideas to flow
over the code. I'm a fan of Open Source and Free Software.

#### When I'm not coding

When I'm not coding I'm a Neuro-linguistic programming practitioner, seems that I

method][wim-hof-method]. I [tap][tap]. I like too much to meditate, particularly the [Shaolin-like][headspace]
meditation. Yoga is a must for my back to recover after a long coding journey.

I'm father of one awesome child and spouse of a cool lady.
