title: About the Jekyll Polymer Theme
---

This theme was created using the Google's Polymer 1.0. It's currently a first draft, so there are still features I plan to add and fix. (See the Github repository for details.)

I created this theme because I couldn't figure out how to set up a Jekyll project to play nicely with Polymer, and because I didn't find any Jekyll blog themes available that used Polymer or followed Google's material design specifications.
